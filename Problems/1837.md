It has begun the IV UFFS Programming Contest! We hope you enjoy the next hours you are going to spend with us, as we hope you have a lot of fun! Good luck!

This is the 3rd year of the Programming Club, an extension program whose primary goal is to help the programmers of the Brazilian region known as Southern Border to get readier to face the computational challenges from both academic and corporate worlds. Our main strategy lies in promoting workshops and training sessions for Programming contests, not only for students of our institution (UFFS), but also for whoever wants to participate. Despite of many issues, we find ourselves very happy with the results we have been achieving. Having other institutions as partners, as UNOCHAPECÓ, URI and UNOESC, we collaborated to make Chapecó in the past two years the 2nd largest site of ICPC Brazilian Subregional Contest, which is another indicator of the enthusiasm our people has in Programming.

In order to warm you up for this particular contest, we shall ask you to write a program which calculates the quotient and the remainder of the division of two integers, can that be? Recall that the quotient and the remainder of the division of an integer a by a non-zero integer b are respectively the only integers *q* and *r* such that 0 ≤ *r* < |*b*| and:

*a* = *b* × *q* + *r*

In case you don't know it, the theorem that guarantees the existence and the uniqueness of the integers *q* and *r* is known as ‘Euclidean Division Theorem’ or ‘Division Algorithm’.

### Input

The input consists of two integers *a* and *b* (-1,000 ≤ *a*, *b* < 1,000).


### Output

Print the quotient *q* followed by the remainder *r* of the division of *a* by *b*.

### Input Sample

```
7 3
```
```
7 -3
```
```
-7 3
```

### Output Sample

```
2 1
```
```
-2 1
```
```
-3 2
```

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a conditional structure to handle the cases where 'a' is negative or positive. If 'a' is negative, we calculate the absolute value of 'b' and use a loop to find the correct remainder 'r' that satisfies the equation a = b × q + r. Then, we calculate the quotient 'q' based on 'r' and 'b'. If 'a' is positive, we simply calculate the quotient and remainder using the built-in division and modulo operators. Finally, we output the calculated quotient and remainder.

## Key Points

- We use a conditional structure to handle cases where 'a' is negative or positive.
- For negative 'a', we calculate the absolute value of 'b' and use a loop to find the correct remainder 'r' that satisfies the equation a = b × q + r.
- For positive 'a', we simply calculate the quotient and remainder using the built-in division and modulo operators.
- The solution correctly calculates and outputs the quotient and remainder for the given input.

## Code

- Support Language: C#

**C# Code:**

```csharp
using System;

namespace Beecrowd
{
    class Problem1837
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string[] input = Console.ReadLine().Split(' ');
            int a = int.Parse(input[0]);
            int b = int.Parse(input[1]);
            int q, r;

            if (a < 0)
            {
                int x = Math.Abs(b);
                for (r = 0; r < x; r++)
                {
                    int y = a - r;
                    if (y % b == 0)
                    {
                        q = y / b;
                        Console.WriteLine($"{q} {r}");
                        return;
                    }
                }
            }
            else
            {
                q = a / b;
                r = a % b;
                Console.WriteLine($"{q} {r}");
            }
        }
    }
}
